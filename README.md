# Image Classification
- Implemented a deep learning model using Tensorflow and Keras.                                                              
- This model classifies 5 different types of images, forest, sea, street, glacier and buildings.
- Built CNN involving convolutional layer, max pooling layer and dropout layer.
- Also Includes a use of Transfer Learning using VGG_16.<br/>
